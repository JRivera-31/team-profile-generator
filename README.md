![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/github/license/JRivera-31/team-profile-generator?color=g&style=plastic")

As an owner/manager of a development business. I want to be able to create team profiles that include employee names, emails, IDs, roles, and/or Github usernames, office numbers, and schools. So that I can quickly create team profile pages for a company website. This project asks the user a series of questions that relate to the information of the employees on the team. Once all desired employee profiles are created, an html file will be rendered with all of the profiles included.
